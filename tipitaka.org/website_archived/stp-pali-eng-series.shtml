      <h2 class="contenttitle"><a name="22"></a>Note on the Pronunciation of Pāli</h2>
      <P>Pāli was a spoken language of northern India in the time of Gotama the Buddha. It was written in the Brāhmī script in India in the time of Emperor Aśoka and has been preserved in the scripts of the various countries where the language has been maintained. In Roman script the following set of diacritical marks are used to indicate the proper pronunciation.</P>
      <P>The alphabet consists of forty-one characters: eight vowels and thirty-three consonants.</P>
      <P><strong>Vowels: </strong>&#9;a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, e, o</P>
      <strong>
      <P>Consonants:</P>
      </strong>
      <P>Velar:&#9;k&#9;kh&#9;g&#9;gh &#9;ṅ</P>
      <P>Palatal:&#9;c&#9;ch&#9;j&#9;jh&#9;ñ</P>
      <P>Retroflex:&#9;ṭ&#9;ṭh&#9;ḍ&#9;ḍh&#9;ṇ</P>
      <P>Dental:&#9;t&#9;th&#9;d&#9;dh&#9;n</P>
      <P>Labial:&#9;p&#9;ph&#9;b&#9;bh&#9;m</P>
      <P>Miscellaneous:&#9;y, r, l, v, s, h, ḷ, ṃ</P>
      <P>The vowels <strong>a, i, u</strong> are short; <strong>ā, ī, ū</strong> are long; <strong>e</strong> and <strong>o</strong> are pronounced long except before double consonants:<em> deva, mettā; loka, phoṭṭhabbā.</em></P>
      <P> <em>&#9;</em><strong>a</strong> is pronounced like ‘a’ in ‘about’; <strong>&#9;ā</strong> like ‘a’ in ‘father’;&#9;</P>
      <P>&#9;<strong>i</strong> is pronounced like ‘i’ in ‘mint’; <strong>&#9;ī</strong> like ‘ee’ in ‘see’;&#9;</P>
      <P>&#9;<strong>u</strong> is pronounced like ‘u’ in ‘put’; <strong>&#9;ū</strong> like ‘oo’ in ‘pool’.</P>
      <P>The consonant <strong>c</strong> is pronounced as in the ‘ch’ in ‘church’. All the aspirated consonants are pronounced with an audible expulsion of breath following the normal unaspirated sound. Therefore <strong>th</strong> is not as in ‘three’ but more like the sound in ‘Thailand’, and <strong>ph</strong> is not as in ‘photo’ but rather is pronounced ‘p’ accompanied by an expulsion of breath.</P>
      <P>The retroflex consonants, <strong>ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh, ṇ</strong> are pronounced with the tip of the tongue turned back, whereas in the dentals, <strong>t,&nbsp;th,&nbsp;d,&nbsp;dh,&nbsp;n,</strong> it touches the upper front teeth.</P>
      <P>The palatal nasal, <strong>ñ,</strong> is the same as the Spanish ‘ñ’, as in señor. The velar nasal, <strong>ṅ,</strong> is pronounced like ‘ng’ in ‘singer’ but occurs only with the other consonants in its group:<em> ṅk, ṅkh,ṅg, ṅgh.</em> The pronunciation of <strong>ṃ</strong> is similar to <strong>ṅ</strong> but occurs most commonly as a terminal nasalization:<em> ‘evaṃ me sutaṃ’.</em> The Pāli <strong>v</strong> is a soft ‘v’ or ‘w’ and <strong>ḷ</strong>,&nbsp;produced with the tongue retroflexed, is almost a combined ‘rl’&nbsp;sound.</P>
      <h2 class="contenttitle"><a name="23"></a><em>Vedanā</em> in the Practice of <em>Satipaṭṭhāna</em></h2>
      <P ALIGN="RIGHT">Vipassana Research Institute</P>
      <P>The practice of the four-fold<em> satipaṭṭhāna</em>, the establishing of awareness, was highly praised by the Buddha in the <em>suttas.</em> Mentioning its importance in the<em> Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta</em>, the Buddha called it<em> ekāyano maggo</em> - the only way for the purification of beings, for overcoming sorrow, for extinguishing suffering, for walking on the path of truth and for realising<em> nibbāna</em> (liberation).<sub><a href="#ref1">1</a></sub></P>
      <P>In this sutta, the Buddha presented a practical method for developing self-knowledge by means of<em> kāyānupassanā</em> (observation of the body),<em> vedanānupassanā</em> (observation of sensations),<em> cittānupassanā</em> (observation of the mind), and<em> dhammānupassanā </em>(observation of the contents of the mind).<sub><a href="#ref2">2</a></sub></P>
      <P>To explore the truth about ourselves, we must examine what we are: body and mind. We must learn to observe these directly within ourselves. Accordingly, we must keep three points in mind: 1) The reality of the body may be imagined by contemplation, but to experience it directly one must work with<em> vedanā</em> (body sensations) arising within it. 2) Similarly, the actual experience of the mind is attained by working with the contents of the mind. Therefore, in the same way as body and sensations cannot be experienced separately, the mind cannot be observed apart from the contents of the mind. 3) Mind and matter are so closely inter-related that the contents of the mind always manifest themselves as sensations in the body. For this reason the Buddha said:</P>
      <DIR>
      <P><em>Vedanā-samosaraṇā sabbe dhammā.</em><sub><a href="#ref3">3</a></sub><br />
        Everything that arises in the mind flows together with sensations.</P>
      </DIR>
      <P>Therefore, observation of sensations offers a means&nbsp; - indeed the only means&nbsp; - &nbsp;to examine the totality of our being, physical as well as mental.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, the Buddha refers to five types of<em> vedanā:</em></P>
      <OL>
        <LI><em>Sukhā vedanā</em>&nbsp; - &nbsp;pleasant sensations</LI>
        <LI><em>Dukkhā vedanā</em>&nbsp; - &nbsp;unpleasant sensations</LI>
        <LI><em>Somanassa vedanā</em>&nbsp; - &nbsp;pleasant mental feeling</LI>
        <LI><em>Domanassa vedanā</em>&nbsp; - &nbsp;unpleasant mental feeling</LI>
        <LI><em>Adukkhamasukhā vedanā</em>&nbsp; - &nbsp;neither unpleasant nor pleasant sensations.</LI>
      </OL>
      <P>In all references to<em> vedanā</em> in the<em> Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta </em>the Buddha speaks of<em> sukhā vedanā, dukkhā vedanā,</em> i.e., the body sensations; or<em> adukkhamasukhā vedanā,</em> which in this context also clearly denotes neutral body sensations.</P>
      <P>The strong emphasis is on body sensations because they work as a direct avenue for the attainment of fruition<em> (nibbāna)</em> by means of "strong dependence condition"<em> (upanissaya-paccayena paccayo),</em> i.e., the nearest dependent condition for our liberation. This fact is succinctly highlighted in the<em> Paṭṭhāna,</em> the seventh text of<em> Abhidhamma Piṭaka</em> under the<em> Pakatūpanissaya,</em> where it is stated:</P>
      <DIR> <em>
      <P>Kāyikaṃ sukhaṃ kāyikassa sukhassa, kāyikassa dukkhassa, phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo.</P>
      <P>Kāyikaṃ dukkhaṃ kāyikassa sukhassa, kāyikassa dukkhassa, phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo.</P>
      <P>Utu kāyikassa sukhassa, kāyikassa dukkhassa, phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo.</P>
      <P>Bhojanaṃ kāyikassa sukhassa, kāyikassa dukkhassa, phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo.</P>
      </em>
      <P><em>Senāsanaṃ kāyikassa sukhassa, kāyikassa dukkhassa, phalasamāpattiyā upanissayapaccayena paccayo.</em><sub><a href="#ref4">4</a></sub></P>
      <P>Pleasant body sensation is related to pleasant sensation of the body, unpleasant sensation of the body, and attainment of fruition<em> (nibbāna)</em> by strong dependence condition.</P>
      <P>Unpleasant body sensation is related to pleasant sensation of the body, unpleasant sensation of the body, and attainment of fruition by strong dependence condition.</P>
      <P>The season (or surrounding environment) is related to pleasant sensation of the body, unpleasant sensation of the body, and attainment of fruition by strong dependence condition.</P>
      <P>Food is related to pleasant sensation of the body, unpleasant sensation of the body, and attainment of fruition by strong dependence condition.</P>
      <P>Lying down and sitting (i.e., the mattress and cushions, or the position of lying, sitting, etc.) is related to pleasant sensation of the body, unpleasant sensation of the body, and attainment of fruition by strong dependence condition.</P>
      </DIR>
      <P>From the above statement it is clear how important<em> vedanā,</em> sensation, is on the path of liberation. The pleasant and unpleasant body sensations, the surrounding environment<em> (utu),</em> the food we eat<em> (bhojanaṃ),</em> and the sleeping and sitting position, the mattress or cushions used, etc.<em> (senāsanaṃ) </em>are all responsible for ongoing body sensations of one type or another. When the sensations are experienced properly, as the Buddha explained in<em> Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta,</em> these become the nearest dependent condition for our liberation.</P>
      <P>There are four dimensions to our nature: the body and its sensations, and the mind and its contents. These provide four avenues for the establishing of awareness in<em> satipaṭṭhāna.</em> In order that the observation be complete, we must experience every facet, which we can only do by means of<em> vedanā.</em> This exploration of truth will remove the delusions we have about ourselves.</P>
      <P>In the same way, to come out of the delusion about the world outside, we must explore how the outside world interacts with our own mind-and-matter phenomenon, our own self. The outside world comes in contact with the individual only at the six sense doors: the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. Since all these sense doors are contained in the body, every contact of the outside world is at the body level. </P>
      <P>The traditional spiritual teachers of India, before the Buddha, in his day and afterwards, expressed the view that craving causes suffering and that to remove suffering one must abstain from the objects of craving. This belief led to various practices of penance and extreme abstinence from external stimuli. In order to develop detachment, the Buddha took a different approach. Having learned to examine the depths of his own mind, he realized that between the external object and the mental reflex of craving is a missing link:<em> vedanā. </em>&nbsp;Whenever we encounter an object through the five physical senses or the mind, a sensation arises; and based on the sensation,<em> taṇhā</em> (craving) arises. If the sensation is pleasant we crave to prolong it, if it is unpleasant we crave to be rid of it. It is in the chain of Dependent Origination<em> (paṭiccasamuppāda)</em> that the Buddha expressed his profound discovery:</P>
      <DIR>
      <P><em>Saḷāyatana-paccayā phasso<br />
        Phassa-paccayā vedanā<br />
        Vedanā-paccayā taṇhā.</em><sub><a href="#ref5">5</a></sub></P>
      <P>Dependent on the six sense-spheres, contact arises.<br />
        Dependent on contact, sensation arises.<br />
        Dependent on sensation, craving arises.</P>
      </DIR>
      <P>The immediate cause for the arising of craving and, consequently, of suffering is not something outside of us but rather the sensations that occur within us.</P>
      <P>Therefore, just as the understanding of<em> vedanā</em> is absolutely essential to understand the interaction between mind and matter within ourselves, the same understanding of<em> vedanā</em> is essential to understand the interaction of the outside world with the individual.</P>
      <P>If this exploration of truth were to be attempted by contemplation or intellectualization, we could easily ignore the importance of<em> vedanā</em>. However, the crux of the Buddha’s teaching is the necessity of understanding the truth not merely at the intellectual level, but by direct experience. For this reason<em> vedanā</em> is defined as follows:</P>
      <DIR>
      <P><em>Yā vedeti ti vedanā, sā vediyati lakkhaṇā, anubhavanarasā...</em><sub><a href="#ref6">6</a></sub></P>
      <P>That which feels the object is<em> vedanā; </em>its characteristic is to feel, it is the essential taste of experience...</P>
      </DIR>
      <P>However, merely to feel the sensations within is not enough to remove our delusions. Instead, it is essential to understand the<em> ti-lakkhaṇā </em>(three characteristics) of all phenomena. We must directly experience<em> anicca </em>(impermanence),<em> dukkha </em>(suffering), and<em> anatta </em>(selflessness) within ourselves. Of these three, the Buddha always stressed the importance of<em> anicca</em> because the realization of the other two will easily follow when we experience deeply the characteristic of impermanence. In the<em> Meghiya Sutta</em> of the<em> Udāna</em> he said:</P>
      <DIR>
      <P><em>Aniccasaññino hi, Meghiya, anattasaññā saṇṭhāti, anattasaññī asmimānasamugghātaṃ pāpuṇāti diṭṭheva dhamme nibbānaṃ.</em><sub><a href="#ref7">7</a></sub></P>
      <P>In one, Meghiya, who perceives impermanence, the perception of selflessness is established. One who perceives what is selfless wins the uprooting of the pride of egotism in this very life, and thus realizes<em> nibbāna.</em></P>
      </DIR>
      <P>Therefore, in the practice of<em> satipaṭṭhāna,</em> the experience of<em> anicca,</em> arising and passing away, plays a crucial role. This experience of<em> anicca </em>as it manifests in the mind and body is also called<em> vipassanā.</em> The practice of Vipassana is the same as the practice of<em> satipaṭṭhāna.</em></P>
      <P>The<em> Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta</em> begins with the observation of the body. Here several different starting points are explained: observing respiration, giving attention to bodily movements, etc. It is from these points that we can progressively develop<em> vedanānupassanā, cittānupassanā </em>&nbsp;and<em> dhammānupassanā. </em>However, no matter from which point the journey starts, stages come which everyone must pass through on the way to the final goal. These are described in important sentences repeated not only at the end of each section of<em> kāyānupassanā</em> but also at the end of<em> vedanānupassanā, cittānupassanā</em> and each section of<em> dhammānupassanā.</em> They are:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI><em>Samudaya-dhammānupassī vā viharati.</em></LI>
        <LI><em>Vaya-dhammānupassī vā viharati.</em></LI>
        <LI><em>Samudaya-vaya-dhammānupassī vā viharati.<sub><a href="#ref8">8</a></sub></em></LI>
      </OL>
      <OL>
        <LI>One dwells observing the phenomenon of arising.</LI>
        <LI>One dwells observing the phenomenon of passing &#9;away.</LI>
        <LI>One dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away.</LI>
      </OL>
      <P>These sentences reveal the essence of the practice of<em> satipaṭṭhāna.</em> Unless these three levels of<em> anicca</em> are experienced, we will not develop<em> paññā </em>(wisdom)&nbsp; - &nbsp;the equanimity based on the experience of impermanence&nbsp; - &nbsp;which leads to detachment and liberation. Therefore, in order to practise any of the four-fold<em> satipaṭṭhānā </em>we have to develop the constant thorough understanding of impermanence which in Pāli is known as<em> sampajañña.</em></P>
      <P> <em>Sampajañña</em> has been often misunderstood. In the colloquial language of the day, it also had the meaning of "knowingly." For example, the Buddha has spoken of<em> sampajānamusā bhāsitā,</em><sub><a href="#ref9">9</a></sub> and<em> sampajāna musāvāda</em><sub><a href="#ref10">10</a></sub> which means "consciously, or knowingly, to speak falsely." This superficial meaning of the term is sufficient in an ordinary context. But whenever the Buddha speaks of<em> vipassanā</em>, of the practice leading to purification, to<em> nibbāna,</em> as here in this<em> sutta,</em> then<em> sampajañña</em> has a specific, technical significance.</P>
      <P>To remain<em> sampajāno</em> (the adjective form of<em> sampajañña</em>), one must meditate on the impermanence of phenomena<em> (anicca-bodha),</em> objectively observing mind and matter without reaction. The understanding of<em> samudaya-vaya-dhammā </em>(the nature of arising and passing away) cannot be by contemplation, which is merely a process of thinking, or by imagination or even by believing; it must be performed with<em> paccanubhoti&nbsp;</em><sub><a href="#ref11">11</a></sub> (direct experience), which is<em> yathābhūta-ñāṇa-dassana&nbsp;</em><sub><a href="#ref12">12</a></sub> (experiential knowledge of the reality as it is). Here the observation of<em> vedanā</em> plays its vital role, because with<em> vedanā</em> a meditator very clearly and tangibly experiences<em> samudaya-vaya</em> (arising and passing away).<em> Sampajañña,</em> in fact, is directly perceiving the arising and passing away of<em> vedanā</em>, wherein all four facets of our being are included.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason that the three essential qualities - to remain<em> ātāpī</em> (ardent),<em> sampajāno,</em> and<em> satimā </em>(aware) - are invariably repeated for each of the four<em> satipaṭṭhānas.</em> And as the Buddha explained,<em> sampajañña</em> is observing the arising and passing away of<em> vedanā</em>.<sub><a href="#ref13">13</a></sub> Hence the part played by<em> vedanā</em> in the practice of<em> satipaṭṭhāna</em> should not be ignored or this practice of<em> satipaṭṭhāna</em> will not be complete.</P>
      <P>In the words of the Buddha:</P>
      <DIR>
      <P><em>Tisso imā, bhikkhave, vedanā. Katamā tisso? Sukhā vedanā, dukkhā vedanā, adukkhamasukhā vedanā. <BR>
        Imā kho, bhikkhave, tisso vedanā. Imāsaṃ kho, bhikkhave, tissannaṃ vedanānaṃ pariññāya cattāro satipaṭṭhānā bhāvetabbā.</em><sub><a href="#ref14">14</a></sub></P>
      <P>Meditators, there are three types of body sensations. What are the three? Pleasant sensations, unpleasant sensations and neutral sensations. Practise, meditators, the four-fold satipaṭṭhānā for the complete understanding of these three sensations.</P>
      </DIR>
      <P>The practice of<em> satipaṭṭhāna,</em> which is the practice of Vipassana, is complete only when one directly experiences impermanence. Sensations provide the nexus where the entire mind and body are tangibly revealed as impermanent phenomena, leading to liberation.</P>

      <P>Thus have I heard:</P>
      <P>At one time the Enlightened One was staying among the Kurus at Kammāsadhamma, a market town of the Kuru people. There the Enlightened One addressed the monks thus: "Monks,"<sub><a href="#note1">1</a></sub> and they replied, "Venerable Sir!" Then the Enlightened One spoke as follows:</P>
      <strong>
      <P>1. <a name="25"></a>Introduction</P>
      </strong>
      <P>This is the one and only way, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the extinguishing of suffering and grief, for walking on the path of truth, for the realisation of<em> nibbāna: </em>that is to say, the fourfold establishing of awareness.<sub><a href="#note2">2</a></sub></P>
      <P>Which four? Here, monks, a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence,<sub><a href="#note3">3</a></sub> observing body in body, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing sensations in sensations, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mind in mind, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter]; he dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, observing mental contents in mental contents, having removed craving and aversion towards the world [of mind and matter].<sub><a href="#note4">4</a></sub></P>

      </strong>
      <P>And how, monks, does a monk dwell observing body in body?</P>
      <P>Here a monk, having gone into the forest, or to the foot of a tree, or to an empty room, sits down cross-legged, keeps his body upright and fixes his awareness in the area around the mouth. With this awareness, he breathes in, with this awareness, he breathes out. Breathing in a deep breath, he understands properly:<sub><a href="#note5">5</a></sub> "I am breathing in a deep breath." Breathing out a deep breath, he understands properly: "I am breathing out a deep breath." Breathing in a shallow breath, he understands properly: "I am breathing in a shallow breath." Breathing out a shallow breath, he understands properly: "I am breathing out a shallow breath." In this way he trains himself: "Feeling the whole body, I shall breathe in." "Feeling the whole body, I shall breathe out," thus he trains himself. "With the bodily activities calmed, I shall breathe in," thus he trains himself. "With the bodily activities calmed, I shall breathe out," thus he trains himself.</P>
      <P>Just as a skilful turner or a turner’s apprentice, while making a long turn understands properly: "I am making a long turn," and while making a short turn, understands properly: "I am making a short turn," just so, the monk, breathing in a deep breath, understands properly: "I am breathing in a deep breath." Breathing in a shallow breath, he understands properly: "I am breathing in a shallow breath." Breathing out a deep breath, he understands properly: "I am breathing out a deep breath." Breathing out a shallow breath, he understands properly: "I am breathing out a shallow breath." In this way he trains himself: "Feeling the whole body, I shall breathe in." "Feeling the whole body, I shall breathe out," thus he trains himself. "With the bodily activities calmed, I shall breathe in," thus he trains himself. "With the bodily activities calmed, I shall breathe out," thus he trains himself.</P>
      <P>Thus<sub><a href="#note6">6</a></sub> he dwells observing body in body internally, or he dwells observing body in body externally, or he dwells observing body in body both internally and externally.<sub><a href="#note7">7</a></sub> Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the body, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the body, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the body. Now his awareness is established: "This is body!"<sub><a href="#note8">8</a></sub> Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness.<sub><a href="#note9">9</a></sub> In this way he dwells detached, without clinging towards anything in the world [of mind and matter].

      <P>Just as if there were a double-mouthed provision bag, full of various kinds of grains and seeds, such as hill-paddy, paddy, mung-beans, cow-peas, sesame seeds and husked rice, and as if there were a man with discerning eyes, who, after having opened that bag would examine the contents, saying: "This is hill-paddy, this is paddy, these are mung-beans, these are cow-peas, these are sesame seeds and this is husked rice"; in this same way, monks, a monk reflects on this very body, that is covered with skin and full of impurities of all kinds from the soles of the feet upwards and from the hair of the head downwards, considering thus: "In this body, there are hairs of the head, hairs of the skin, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidney, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach with its contents, faeces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid and urine."</P>

      <P>Just as if, monks, a skilful cow-butcher or his apprentice, after having slaughtered a cow and having divided it into portions, would sit down at the junction of four roads; in the same way, monks, a monk reflects on this very body, however it is placed or disposed, considering the material elements: "In this body, there is the earth-element, the water-element, the fire-element and the air-element."</P>

      <P>Again, monks, a monk dwells observing mental contents in mental contents, as regards the four noble truths. </P>
      <P>How, monks, does a monk dwell observing mental contents in mental contents, as regards the four noble truths?</P>
      <P>Here, monks, a monk understands properly as it is, "This is suffering"; he understands properly as it is, "This is the arising of suffering"; he understands properly as it is, "This is the cessation of suffering"; he understands properly as it is, "This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering." </P>
      <strong>
      <P><a name="41"></a>Exposition of the Truth of Suffering</P>
      </strong>
      <P>And what, monks, is the Noble Truth of Suffering?</P>
      <P>Birth is suffering, old age is suffering, (sickness is suffering),<sub><a href="#note24">24</a></sub> death is suffering, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress are suffering, the association with something that one does not like is suffering, the disassociation with something that one does like is suffering, not to get what one desires is suffering; in short, the clinging to the five aggregates is suffering. </P>
      <P>And what, monks, is birth? If there is birth for all kinds of beings in whatever kind of existence, their conception, their being born, their becoming, the coming into manifestation of their aggregates, the acquisition of their sense faculties - this, monks, is called birth.</P>
      <P>And what, monks, is old age? If there is old age for all kinds of beings in whatever kind of existence, their getting frail and decrepit, the breaking [of their teeth], their becoming grey and wrinkled, the running down of their life span, the deterioration of their sense faculties - this, monks, is called old age.</P>
      <P>And what, monks, is death? If there is vanishing and passing away for all kinds of beings in whatever kind of existence, their disintegration, their disappearance, their dying, their death, the completion of their life span, the dissolution of the aggregates, the discarding of the body, the destruction of their vitality - this, monks, is called death.</P>
      <P>And what, monks, is sorrow? Whenever one, monks, is affected by various kinds of loss and misfortune, that are followed by this or that kind of painful state of mind, by sorrow, by mourning, by sorrowfulness, by inward grief, and by deep inward woe - this, monks, is called sorrow.</P>
      <P>And what, monks, is lamentation? Whenever one, monks, is affected by various kinds of loss and misfortune, that are followed by this or that kind of painful state of mind, by wailing and crying, by lamentation, by deep wailing, by deep lamentation, by the state of deep wailing and deep lamentation - this, monks, is called lamentation.</P>
      <P>And what, monks, is pain?<sub><a href="#note25">25</a></sub> If there is, monks, any kind of bodily pain, any kind of bodily unpleasantness or any kind of painful or unpleasant sensation as a result of bodily contact - this, monks, is called pain.</P>
      <P>And what, monks, is grief?<sub><a href="#note25">25</a></sub> If there is, monks, any kind of mental pain, any kind of mental unpleasantness or any kind of painful or unpleasant sensation as a result of mental contact - this, monks, is called grief.</P>
      <P>And what, monks, is distress? Whenever one, monks, is affected by various kinds of loss and misfortune, that are followed by this or that kind of painful state of mind, by tribulation, by distress, affliction with distress and affliction with great distress - this, monks, is called distress.</P>
      <P>And what, monks, is the suffering of being associated with what one does not like? Wherever and whenever one finds unpleasant, disagreeable or disliked objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or of the mind, or, whenever and wherever one finds that there are wishers of one’s own misfortune, harm, difficulties or of one’s own insecurity; if one gets associated, one meets, one comes into contact or gets combined with them - this, monks, is called the suffering of being associated with what one does not like. </P>
      <P>And what, monks, is the suffering of being disassociated with what one does like? Wherever and whenever one finds pleasant, agreeable or liked objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or of the mind, or, whenever and wherever one finds that there are wishers of one’s own fortune, prosperity, comfort or of one’s own security, like mother and father, like brother and sister, like friends and colleagues or relatives; if one gets disassociated, one does not meet, one does not come into contact or does not get combined with them - this, monks, is called the suffering of being disassociated with what one does like. </P>
      <P>And what, monks, is not getting what one desires? In beings, monks, who are subject to birth the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to birth! Oh, truly, may there be no new birth for us!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering.</P>
      <P>In beings, monks, who are subject to old age the desire arises: "Oh, truly, that we were not subject to old age! Oh, truly, may we not be subject to old age!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering.</P>

Oh, truly, may we not suffer from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress!" But this cannot be obtained by mere desire; and not to get what one wants is suffering. </P>
      <P>And how, monks, in short, is clinging to the five aggregates suffering? It is as follows - clinging to the aggregate of matter is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of sensation is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of perception is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of reaction is suffering, clinging to the aggregate of consciousness is suffering. This, monks, in short, is called suffering because of clinging to these five aggregates.</P>

After the fading away of rapture he dwells in equanimity, aware with constant thorough understanding of impermanence, and he experiences in his body the bliss of which the noble ones say: "That bliss is experienced by one with equanimity and awareness." Thus he enters the third absorption and dwells therein. After the eradication of pleasure and pain and with joy and grief having previously passed away, he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain, the fourth absorption, that is totally purified by equanimity and awareness and he dwells therein. This, monks, is called Right Concentration.</P>
      <P>This, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of Suffering. </P>
      <P>Thus he dwells observing mental contents in mental contents internally, or he dwells observing mental contents in mental contents externally, or he dwells observing mental contents in mental contents both internally and externally. Thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising in the mental contents, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of passing away in the mental contents, thus he dwells observing the phenomenon of arising and passing away in the mental contents. Now his awareness is established: "These are mental contents!" Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness. In this way he dwells detached, without clinging towards anything in the world [of mind and matter]. This is how, monks, a monk dwells observing mental contents in mental contents as regards the Four Noble Truths. </P>

      <P>6. <a name="45"></a>The Results of the Establishing of Awareness</P>
      </strong>
      <P>Indeed, monks, whoever practises this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner<sub><a href="#note28">28</a></sub> for seven years, he may expect one of two results: in this very life highest wisdom<sub><a href="#note29">29</a></sub> or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner.<sub><a href="#note30">30</a></sub></P>
      <P>Let alone seven years, monks. Should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for six years, one of two results may be expected in him: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner.</P>
      <P>Let alone six years, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone five years, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone four years, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone three years, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone two years, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone one year, monks. Should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for seven months, one of two results may be expected in him: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner.</P>
      <P>Let alone seven months, monks...</P>

      <P>Let alone four months, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone three months, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone two months, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone one month, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone half a month, monks...</P>
      <P>Let alone half a month, monks. Should any person practise this fourfold establishing of awareness in this manner for seven days, one of two results may be expected in him: in this very life highest wisdom or, if a substratum of aggregates remains, the stage of non-returner.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason that it was said: "This is the one and only way, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the extinguishing of suffering and grief, for walking on the path of truth, for the realisation of <em>nibbāna: </em>that is to say, the fourfold establishing of awareness."</P>
      <P>Thus the Enlightened One spoke. Glad in heart, the monks welcomed the words of the Enlightened One.</P>

      <P>The End of the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta</P>
      <h2 class="contenttitle"><a name="46"></a>Notes</h2>
      </strong>
      <P><strong>N.B. </strong>For clarity, the footnoted passage will be indicated in the notes by Pāli in italics followed immediately by the English translation in square brackets, e.g.<em> sati</em> [awareness]. Other Pāli words used in the notes will be followed by their equivalent terms in parentheses where appropriate, e.g.<em> anicca</em> (impermanence).</P>
      <P><a name="note1"></a>1.&#9;The word<em> bhikkhū </em>[monks] was used to address all the people who listened to the discourses given by the Buddha. Thus every meditator, everyone who is walking on the path of Dhamma, though not literally a<em> bhikkhu,</em> can benefit by following the instructions given here.</P>
      <P><a name="note2"></a>2.&#9;<em>Satipaṭṭhāna </em>[establishing of awareness]<em> Sati </em>means "awareness."<em> Satipaṭṭhāna </em>implies that the meditator has to work diligently and constantly to become firmly established in awareness or mindfulness. Therefore we have used "the establishing of awareness," to convey the sense that one actively strives to maintain continuous awareness of mind and body at the level of sensations, as will become clear from the rest of the discourse.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;There are certain passages in the Buddha’s discourses where<em> sati</em> has the meaning of "memory." (<em>Dīgha-nikāya: </em>VRI I. 411; II. 374; PTS I. 180; II. 292). This is especially true when he refers to the special ability of remembering past lives which is developed by means of the practice of the<em> jhānas </em>(deep absorption concentration). But in the context of<em> Satipaṭṭhāna,</em> the practice of Vipassana, leading not to the<em> jhānas</em> but to purification of mind,<em> sati</em> can only be understood to mean awareness of the present moment rather than a memory of the past (or a dream of the future).</P>
      <P><a name="note3"></a>3.&#9;The Buddha always included the term<em> sampajañña </em>[constant thorough understanding of impermanence] or<em> sampajāno</em> (the adjective form of <em>sampajañña</em>) whenever he was asked to explain<em> sati </em>(awareness). (See, for example, the definition of<em> sammāsati</em> in the Chapter on the Four Noble Truths: Truth of the Path.) As a result of the frequent association of these words,<em> sampajañña</em> has often been defined as nearly synonymous with<em> sati&nbsp;</em> - as "full awareness," or "clear comprehension" - or as an exhortation to remain mindful. Another traditional translation of<em> sampajañña</em>, which is closer to the full meaning is "thorough understanding."</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;In the<em> Sutta Piṭaka</em> the Buddha gave two explanations of the term. In the<em> Saṃyutta-nikāya</em> (VRI III.<em> </em>401; PTS V, 180-1) he defines it as follows:</P>
      <em>
      <P>Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sampajāno hoti? Idha bhikkhave, bhikkhuno viditā vedanā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti; viditā saññā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti; viditā vitakkā uppajjanti, viditā upaṭṭhahanti, viditā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti. Evaṃ kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sampajāno hoti.</P>
      </em>
      <P>And how, monks, does a monk understand thoroughly? Here, monks, a monk experiences sensations arising in him, experiences their persisting, and experiences their vanishing; he experiences perceptions arising in him, experiences their persisting, and experiences their vanishing; he experiences each initial application of the mind [on an object] arising in him, experiences its persisting, and experiences its vanishing. This, monks, is how a monk understands thoroughly.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;In the above statement it is clear that one is<em> sampajāno</em> only when one understands the characteristic of impermanence (arising, persisting and vanishing). This understanding must be based on sensation<em> (viditā vedanā).</em> If the characteristic of impermanence is not experienced at the level of<em> vedanā,</em> then one’s understanding is merely an intellectualization, since it is only through sensation that direct experience occurs. The statement further indicates that<em>&nbsp;sampajañña</em> lies in the experience of the impermanence of<em> saññā</em> and<em> vitakkā.</em> Here we should note that impermanence understood at the level of<em> vedanā</em> actually covers all three cases since according to the Buddha’s teaching in the<em> Aṅguttara-nikāya</em> (VRI III.<em> Dasakanipāta</em>, 58; PTS V. 107):</P>
      <em>
      <P>Vedanā-samosaraṇā sabbe dhammā.</P>
      </em>
      <P>Everything that arises in the mind flows together with sensations.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;The second explanation of<em> sampajañña</em> given by the Buddha emphasizes that it must be continuous. In several places he repeats the words of the<em> Sampajānapabbaṃ</em> of<em> Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta</em>, as in this passage from the<em> Mahāparinibbāna Sutta</em> (<em>Dīgha-nikāya</em> II: VRI. 160; PTS 95):</P>
      <em>
      <P>Kathañca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sampajāno hoti? Idha bhikkhave, bhikkhu abhikkante paṭikkante sampajānakārī hoti, ālokite vilokite sampajānakārī hoti, samiñjite pasārite sampajānakārī hoti, saṅghāṭipattacīvaradhāraṇe sampajānakārī hoti, asite pīte khāyite sāyite sampajānakārī hoti, uccārapassāvakamme sampajānakārī hoti, gate ṭhite nisinne sutte jāgarite bhāsite tuṇhībhāve sampajānakārī hoti.</P>
      </em>
      <P>And how, monks, does a monk understand thoroughly? Here, monks, a monk, while going forward or backward, he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence; whether he is looking straight ahead or looking sideways, he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence; while he is bending or stretching, he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence; whether wearing his robes or carrying his bowl, he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence; whether he is eating, drinking, chewing or savouring, he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence; while attending to the calls of nature, he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence; whether he is walking, standing, sitting, sleeping or waking, speaking or in silence, he does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;With proper understanding of the teaching of the Buddha, it becomes clear that if this continuous<em> sampajañña</em> consists only of the thorough understanding of the external processes of walking, eating, and other activities of the body, then what is being practised is merely<em> sati.</em> If, however, the constant thorough understanding includes the characteristic of the arising and passing away of<em> vedanā</em> while the meditator is performing these activities, then<em> sampajāno satimā</em> is being practised,<em> paññā </em>(wisdom) is being developed.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;The Buddha describes this more specifically in this passage from the<em> Aṅguttara-nikāya</em> (VRI I.<em> Catukkanipāta</em>, 12; PTS II 15) in words reminiscent of<em> Sampajānapabbaṃ:</em></P>
      <em>
      <P>Yataṃ care yataṃ tiṭṭhe, yataṃ acche yataṃ saye &#9;<BR>
        yataṃ samiñjaye bhikkhu, yatamenaṃ pasāraye&#9;<BR>
        uddhaṃ tiriyaṃ apācīnaṃ, yāvatā jagato gati,&#9;<BR>
        samavekkhitā ca dhammānaṃ, khandhānaṃ udayabbayaṃ.</P>
      </em>
      <P>Whether the monk walks or stands or sits or lies,&#9;<BR>
        whether he bends or stretches, above, across, backwards,&#9;<BR>
        whatever his course in the world,&#9;<BR>
        he observes the arising and passing away of the aggregates.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;The Buddha clearly emphasized the thorough understanding of<em>&nbsp;anicca </em>(impermanence) in all bodily and mental activities. Therefore, since the proper understanding of this technical term,<em> sampajañña, </em>is so critical for an understanding of this<em> sutta</em>, we have translated it as "the constant thorough understanding of impermanence," even though this definition is less concise than the traditional "thorough understanding."</P>
      <P><a name="note4"></a>4.&#9;In this introductory paragraph the Buddha repeats a basic verbal formula reminding us that we must continuously observe "body in body," or "sensations in sensations," or "mind in mind," or "mental contents in mental contents." Though these verbal constructs may seem unusual, they refer to the fact that this observation has to be directly experiential rather than dealing only with thought, imagination or contemplation of the object.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;The Buddha emphasizes this point in the<em> Ānāpānasati Sutta</em> (<em>Mājjhima-nikāya </em>III: VRI. 149; PTS 83-4), where he describes the progressive stages of the practice of<em> ānāpāna</em> meditation. In the section where he explains how the four<em> satipaṭṭhānā </em>are brought to perfection by<em> ānāpāna </em>he says:</P>
      <em>
      <P>...kāyesu kāyaññatarāhaṃ, bhikkhave, evaṃ vadāmi yadidaṃ assāsapassāsā. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, kāye kāyānupassī tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ. </P>
      </em>
      <P>...Monks, when I say, ‘inhalation-exhalation,’ it is like another body in the body. Observing body in body in this way, monks, at that time a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, having removed craving and aversion towards this world [of mind and matter].</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;This indicates that practising<em> ānāpāna</em> meditation leads directly to experiencing the body, which means feeling sensations in the body. The sensations may be related to the breath, the oxygen flowing in the blood, etc. but those details are not important. The body-in-body experience is not imagined or contemplated but felt throughout the body. More specifically, he continues:</P>
      <em>
      <P>...vedanāsu vedanāññatarāhaṃ, bhikkhave, evaṃ vadāmi yadidaṃ assāsapassāsānaṃ sādhukaṃ manasikāraṃ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, vedanāsu vedanānupassī tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ. </P>
      </em>
      <P>...monks, when I say, ‘by proper attention to inhalation-exhalation,’ it is like other sensations in the sensations. Observing sensations in sensations in this way, monks, at that time a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, having removed craving and aversion towards this world [of mind and matter].</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;By equating the observation of the breath with experiencing sensations the Buddha is pointing to the critical importance of the body and the sensations in proper practice of meditation. It is the awareness of these sensations by direct experience throughout the body, while maintaining equanimity with the understanding of impermanence, that perfects the four<em> satipaṭṭhānas</em>. </P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;It is instructive that in<em> Ānāpānasati Sutta</em> he describes the experience of body-in-body and sensations-in-sensations as one observes the breath but when he turns to the observation of mind he does not continue with the same verbal formula. Instead, he again directs our attention to the importance of<em> sampajañña</em>:</P>
      <em>
      <P>...citte cittānupassī, bhikkhave, tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ. Nāhaṃ, bhikkhave, muṭṭhassatissa asampajānassa ānāpānassatiṃ vadāmi.</P>
      </em>
      <P>...observing mind in mind, monks, at that time a monk dwells ardent with awareness and constant thorough understanding of impermanence, having removed craving and aversion towards this world [of mind and matter]. I say, monks, one who is inattentive, who is not constantly aware of impermanence, he is not one doing<em> ānāpāna</em>.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;Beginning with<em> ānāpāna </em>as a starting point the practice described has led directly to Vipassana, i.e., to the practice of the four<em> satipaṭṭhānas. </em>And here we see how emphatically the Buddha states that, even while observing the mind, one is not practising properly unless there is awareness of impermanence with the direct experience of the sensations.</P>
      <P><a name="note5"></a>5.&#9;<em>Pajānāti </em>[understands properly] means, "to understand, to know deeply or intently with wisdom." It is the result of the intensification of the verb<em> jānāti </em>(he or she knows) by the addition of the prefix<em> pa-</em>, from <em>paññā</em> (wisdom). </P>
      <P><a name="note6"></a>6.&#9;<em>Iti ajjhattaṃ...kāye kāyānupassī viharati. </em>[Thus he dwells...dwells observing body in body.] This paragraph is repeated twenty-one times throughout the<em> Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta</em>, with variations according to which section of the four<em> satipaṭṭhānas</em> one has reached: body, sensations, mind or mental contents.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;In this key paragraph the Buddha describes the common steps in Vipassana that all meditators must pass through no matter what section of the<em> sutta </em>one begins with. In each repetition, this paragraph focuses our attention on the essential fact that, no matter if one is observing body, sensations, mind or mental contents, one must understand the fundamental characteristic of arising and passing away. This understanding of impermanence then leads directly to the total detachment from the world of mind and matter which takes us to<em> nibbāna</em> (liberation).</P>
      <P><a name="note7"></a>7.&#9;<em>Bahiddhā</em> &nbsp;[externally] is sometimes translated as "outer things" or "observing another’s body." In the following section, on the observation of sensations, it has sometimes been taken to mean "feeling the sensations of others." While such an experience is not impossible, it would be practised only at a very high stage of development. According to the<em> sutta</em>, the meditator is asked to sit alone somewhere in a forest, under a tree or in an empty room, and start practising. In such a situation observing others would be meaningless, and the sensations of someone or something else would be of no use. For a meditator, therefore, "externally," meaning the surface of the body, is the most practical definition of<em> bahiddhā.</em></P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;See also note no. <a href="#note19">19</a>.</P>
      <P><a name="note8"></a>8.&#9;The Pāli<em> atthi kāyo</em> [this is body] indicates that the meditator at this stage clearly understands experientially, at the level of sensations, "body" in its true nature: its characteristic of arising and passing away. Therefore the meditator neither makes any identification of "body" as male or female, young or old, beautiful or ugly, etc., nor has any attachment towards "I," "me," or "mine."</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;In the other three sections of the<em> sutta</em>, the sensations, mind and mental contents are each identified similarly in their corresponding paragraphs: "This is sensation," "This is mind," "These are mental contents," to indicate the lack of identification of the meditator with the object, and his or her understanding of the object in its true characteristic of<em> anicca</em> (impermanence).</P>
      <P><a name="note9"></a>9.&#9;<em>Yāvadeva ñāṇamattāya paṭissatimattāya</em> [Thus he develops his awareness to such an extent that there is mere understanding along with mere awareness.] The mind of the meditator at this stage is absorbed in the wisdom of<em> anicca</em> (the arising and passing away of sensations), with no identification beyond this awareness. With the base of this awareness he develops understanding with his own experience. This is<em> paññā</em> (wisdom). With his awareness thus established in<em> anicca</em>, there is no attraction to the world of mind and matter.</P>
      <P><a name="note10"></a>10.&#9;This includes the changing of position as well as the four basic postures of the body. Whatever one does, an ardent meditator is always aware with wisdom:<em> yathā yathā vā…tathā tathā naṃ pajānāti</em> (whatever he does…that he understands properly).</P>
      <P><a name="note11"></a>11.&#9;<em>Sampajānakārī hoti</em> [does so with constant thorough understanding of impermanence] literally means: "He is doing (all the time)<em> sampajañña</em>." It is helpful to follow the progression of the Buddha’s words in Pāli: he uses<em> "jānāti"</em> (he knows),<em> "pajānāti"</em> (understands properly - intently or deeply with wisdom), and<em> "sampajānāti"</em> (he constantly and thoroughly understands the impermanent nature of his experience). Each word indicates a progressive step, that the meditator takes by following the instructions given in the<em> sutta</em>. Thus he proceeds from simple experience, to understanding based on direct experience, up to thorough and constant understanding of the impermanence, at the level of sensations, of each and every experience.</P>
      <P><a name="note12"></a>12.&#9;<em>Sāmisa</em> [with attachment] literally means:<em> sa-āmisa </em>(with-flesh);<em> nirāmisa </em>[without attachment]: means<em> nir-āmisa</em> (without-flesh). They can also be rendered as: "impure" and "pure," "material" and "immaterial" or, "sensual" and "nonsensual." A common interpretation is that a sensation which is<em> sāmisa</em> is related to the world of sensual pleasures and a<em> nirāmisa </em>sensation is a sensation related to the higher meditational realms.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;In this context, related to the observation of sensations without any reaction of craving or aversion by the meditator, we have used "with attachment" and "without attachment." These terms seem clearest insofar as they relate to the practice.</P>
      <P><a name="note13"></a>13. See note no. <a href="#note7">7</a>.</P>
      <P><a name="note14"></a>14.&#9;<em>Citta </em>[mind], in this context, is correctly translated as "mind." The meditator experiences different states of mind and observes them in an objective and detached manner. It might be misleading to translate<em> citta</em> here as "thought."</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;<em>Citte cittānupassī</em> [mind in mind] refers to the experiential nature of the observation required (see note no. 4).</P>
      <P><a name="note15"></a>15.&#9;<em>Saṅkhittaṃ</em> [collected] and<em> vikkhittaṃ</em> [scattered] correspond to mental states either scattered because of the<em> pañca nīvaraṇā</em>, the "five hindrances," or collected when the hindrances are not manifesting their respective effects. (See the following Section 5A, The Hindrances.)</P>
      <P><a name="note16"></a>16.&#9;<em>Mahaggataṃ cittaṃ </em>[expanded mind] means literally: "mind having become great;" i.e., by the practice and development of the<em> jhānas </em>(the practice of absorption<em> samādhi</em>). It refers to a mind expanded by the practice of these deep<em> samādhis,</em> rather than the stage transcending mind and matter.<em> Amahaggataṃ cittaṃ </em>[unexpanded mind] thus means a mind not having become expanded in this way.</P>
      <P><a name="note17"></a>17.&#9;<em>Sa-uttaraṃ</em> [surpassable] means: "having something higher than that" or "not superior." This type of mind is still connected with the mundane field.<em> Anuttaraṃ</em> [unsurpassable], correspondingly, is a mind that has reached a very high stage of meditation, where nothing is superior. Therefore "surpassable" and "unsurpassable," though not very precise, seem to be the nearest translations. </P>
      <P><a name="note18"></a>18.&#9;<em>Samāhitaṃ </em>[concentrated] and<em> asamāhitaṃ</em> [unconcentrated] are related to the type of<em> samādhi </em>(concentration) that one has gained; states of concentration that are called:<em> upacāra</em> (neighbourhood concentration, i.e. approaching a level of absorption) and<em> appanā samādhi </em>(absorption, or attainment, concentration).<em> Asamāhitaṃ cittaṃ</em> therefore describes a mental state without that depth of concentration. </P>
      <P><a name="note19"></a>19.&#9;<em>Iti ajjhattaṃ...bahiddhā...ajjhattabahiddhā vā citte cittānupassī viharati </em>[Thus he dwells observing mind in mind internally... externally...both internally and externally]. Applied to the mind (and in the next section, the mental contents) this sentence has sometimes been interpreted to mean that the meditator observes his own mind (internally) and the mind of others (externally). This can be done only by a very highly developed meditator, therefore it is not a practical instruction for most people.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;In this section the meditator is asked to experience directly the mind in mind<em> (citte cittānupassī).</em> This can be done only by observing whatever arises in the mind. As the body was experienced by means of what arises on the body (i.e., sensation); the mind is experienced only when something arises in the mind (i.e., the mental contents). When the mind is observing the internal objects - its own internal mental states - it is observing the mind in mind internally.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;To observe the mind and mental contents externally means to observe experientially that any object which comes in contact with the mind-body through any of the six sense doors (that is, an external stimulus) causes an internal reaction. Any sight, sound, taste, smell, touch or thought results in a sensation and the mind feels it. Of course, internal mental states and sensation resulting from contact with external objects will all mix and flow together.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;Therefore, again, we see the importance of the Buddha’s statement: </P>
      <em>
      <P>Vedanā-samosaraṇā sabbe dhammā.</P>
      </em>
      <P>Everything that arises in the mind flows together with sensations. (<em>Aṅguttara-nikāya:</em> VRI III.<em> Dasakanipāta</em>, 58; PTS V. 107)</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;Whether the object is internal or external, if the mind remains within the body observing the sensations, then it is directly experiencing the mind and mental contents in a tangible way that easily allows the meditator to experience the impermanent nature of the entire mind-matter phenomenon.</P>
      <P><a name="note20"></a>20.&#9;<em>Pañca upādānakkhandhā</em> [the five aggregates of clinging] consist of:<em> rūpakkhandha</em> (the material aggregate) connected with<em> kāya</em> (body) and the four<em> nāmakkhandhā</em> (aggregates of mind), which are:<em>&#9;viññāṇakkhandha</em> (the aggregate of consciousness);&#9;<BR>
        <em>&#9;saññākkhandha</em> (the aggregate of perception);&#9;<BR>
        <em>&#9;vedanākkhandha</em> (the aggregate of feeling of sensations on the body)&#9;<BR>
        <em>&#9;saṅkhārakkhandha</em> (the aggregate of reaction). </P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;The<em> pañca upādānakkhandhā</em> are aggregates of clinging, or attachment, in two ways. They are the basic objects to which we cling because of our illusion that the five together make up "I," "me." In addition, the continual arising of the aggregates - with the attendant suffering that goes with the cycle of becoming - is due to the clinging toward this illusory "I." Aggregates and clinging always go together, except in the case of an<em> arahant,</em> who has<em> pañca khandhā, </em>the five aggregates, but no clinging towards them; no<em> upādāna </em>(attachment or clinging) is possible for such a person.</P>
      <P><a name="note21"></a>21.&#9;Here<em> dhamma</em> has to be understood as the law of nature, the nature of the law in its totality. At a superficial level<em> dhammavicaya</em> [investigation of Dhamma] can be understood to mean intellectual investigation of the law. But to become a factor of enlightenment<em> dhammavicaya</em> must become an experiential investigation - direct experience of the phenomenon of arising and passing away at the level of sensations.</P>
      <P><a name="note22"></a>22.&#9;<em>Pīti</em> [rapture] is difficult to translate into English. It is often translated as: "joy," "delight," "bliss" or "thrill." Each of these words conveys at least partially the meaning of mental and physical pleasantness. For<em> pīti</em> to become a factor of enlightenment it must be experienced in its true nature as ephemeral, arising and passing away. Only then can the meditator avoid the danger of becoming attached to the pleasantness of this stage.</P>
      <P><a name="note23"></a>23.&#9;As with the previous factor of enlightenment,<em> passaddhi</em> [tranquillity], becomes a factor of enlightenment only when it is experienced as impermanent,<em> anicca</em> - arising and passing away. The danger for the meditator here is that this stage of deep tranquillity might be mistaken for the final goal of<em> nibbāna</em>. This deep illusion<em> (moha)</em> is removed by the experience of<em> anicca</em> as one experiences this tranquillity.</P>
      <P><a name="note24"></a>24.&#9;In the texts<em> byādhi</em> [sickness] is sometimes included, sometimes omitted.</P>
      <P><a name="note25"></a>25.&#9;Here it is very clear that the word<em> dukkha</em> [pain] is related to the body, and<em> domanassa</em> [grief] to the mind. Correspondingly,<em> sukha </em>(bodily pleasure) is related to the body,<em> somanassa </em>(mental pleasure) to the mind and<em> adukkhamasukha </em>(neither painful nor pleasant) as neutral, to both body and mind.</P>
      <P><a name="note26"></a>26.&#9;The word<em> loke</em> [world] has a wide spectrum of meaning: "universe," "world," "region," "people." In this entire section it is used in connection with everything that one experiences at any of the six senses, and the entire process of the contact between the senses and their respective objects. So in this context<em> loke</em> is to be understood as the "world" of the mind-body phenomenon. Therefore the entire "world" can be directly experienced at the level of the sensations in the body that result from any of these interactions.</P>
      <P><a name="note27"></a>27.&#9;<em>Vitakko</em> [thought conception] refers to the initial application of the mind to an object. This is contrasted with<em> vicāro </em>[rolling in thoughts] in the next paragraph, which refers to a sustained application of the mind on an object.</P>
      <P>&#9;&#9;In the later section, dealing with the<em> jhānas</em> (see pp. 72,73), the translation reflects this relationship more directly since the context is one of deep absorption in the object of meditation rather than one where mental impurities are arising.</P>
      <P><a name="note28"></a>28.&#9;<em>Evaṃ </em>[in this manner], as explained throughout the entire<em> sutta</em>, is<em> ātāpī sampajāno satimā</em> (ardent with awareness of mind and body at the level of sensations and with constant thorough understanding of impermanence). In order to achieve these guaranteed results the continuity should be<em> sampajaññaṃ na riñcati </em>([the meditator] does not lose the constant thorough understanding of impermanence even for a moment).</P>
      <P><a name="note29"></a>29.&#9;The final stage of liberation of an<em> arahant</em>. </P>
      <P><a name="note30"></a>30.&#9;The stage of an<em> anāgāmī</em> [non-returner] is the third and next-to-last stage of liberation.</P>
