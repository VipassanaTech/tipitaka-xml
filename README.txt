/conversion scripts/ - contains scripts and source code to perform various conversions.
1) aalekh2uni.exe - converts from CSCD aalekh Devanagari to plain text unicode Devanagari. The batch file aalekh2uni.bat can be used to perform this conversion on all files in the current directory.

2) pitaka2xml.exe - converts from plain text unicode Devanagari to XML Devanagari. The batch file pitaka2xml.bat can be used to perform this conversion on all .txt files in the current directory.

3) deva2*.exe - converts from Devanagari XML to XML of various other scripts 
(Note: script abbreviations are defined by ISO 15924 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_15924_codes)

/root text files/ - contains the files generated by aalekh2uni.exe which were then manually modified to apply various corrections.

/tipitaka.org/ - contains folders for the various scripts which contain CSS, XSL, and JS navigation tree files. The /Deva/cscd folder contains the most recent version of the Devanagari XML. No other XML is stored in the repository as all others can be generated as needed from the Devanagari XML using deva*.exe.
